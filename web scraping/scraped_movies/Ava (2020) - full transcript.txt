Mr. Hamilton. Yes. You have water in the door. Great. Straight to the convention center? Absolutely. You're American. Mm-hm. Arkansas. Ah, Southern girl. Yes sir, I am. Call me Peter. Sir makes me feel like I'm retiring to Florida. Oh, I'm so sorry about that. What's your name? I'm Brandy. I've had one of those fuckers of a morning, Brandy. Mm, I'm so sorry to hear that. I had this meeting, and this passive-aggressive motherfucker insinuates all this shit about me. Why was I so blind to this fucking prick who was suggesting I wasn't very good at my job? Which I am, by the way. God love him. You know, Croesus once said, "Count no man happy until the end is known." Ah. Look at you. Let's make a deal. I don't know you, and you don't know me, and since we don't know each other, we've got nothing to lose. We can just be real. Okay? No masks. Just the experience of Brandy and Peter. What do you say? Does this usually work? Okay. No masks, no bullshit. I'm up here thinking that I'd love to pull the car over, get in the back, have a drink with you, and then... see what else happens. Oh, I wish I could. I thought... I said I'd love to have a drink. I have one sip of that, and someone's going to jail, someone's going to the ER. I didn't come back here for a drink, Peter. I wanted to see what you looked like from this angle. You like what you see? Your pictures do not do you justice. Come here. Hold on a second, Peter. I just want to ask you a question first. Yes, ma'am. You're the boss now. What'd you do? What did I do? Well, I don't know when you did it, but... I know you did something, Peter. What are you talking about? Why would someone not want you to be alive anymore? You know, if you modernize it, what Croesus actually said is, Count no man happy until he's had a good death. I genuinely try to give my subjects a good death when I can. But I can't do that unless I know what you did. This isn't funny. Who put you up to this? Was it Ronny? Aw, that bastard. I knew it was. Let's give him a call. Put the phone down, please. Ah, fuck! Oh, please! Please don't, please! Don't beg. Just think of it as though it's already happened, because it has. Now answer my question. Nothing! I'm a nothing! I'm a nobody! I just move money around for companies! So you don't have an answer for me? No! No, no, wait, wait. Okay, okay. I know why. I know why. No, you don't. Subjects rarely do. Okay, okay, please. I'll pay you. I'm sure you hear this all the time, but I'll give you every cent that I've got. I'm in finance! Executive code 74598CG. Management Code 840227. Confirmed. Subject's closed. You sound a little off, kiddo. Anything to share? Nope. Nothing to report? Gotta get a new set of wigs. I don't know if they've shrunk, or my head's grown. Any hiccups? You can stop worrying about me now. I'll stop worrying when I stop worrying. How's the mind? Clear. Fine. You don't sound clear. Shut up. Or fine. Just please shut up. I'm just still in it, that's all. Did you close this subject with dignity? Yep. Was management compromised? Nope. Then move the fuck on. I think I might go back to Boston for a bit. Is that a good idea? It's personal, Duke. You want to talkprep for Riyadh? Later? Okay. Well, let's go over it like it's your S-A-Ts, 'cause management asked for you specifically. They'll be watching. We cover every exit on this one. Duke. I'll call you if you don't call me. Keep your head down and your powder dry, kiddo. Head down, powder dry. Got it. Just doing the final boarding check. Flying time to Boston will be approximately six hours and 40 minutes, bringing us in just ahead of schedule. Checking in. Campbell. Hello? Management code 980456. Executive Order 98602FT We have a situation. She's one of our own, so do nothing until you get the green light. Just keep her in your sights. Financial advisor Peter Hawthorne has been discovered outside Paris inside a burned car. French police are describing it as an assassination style killing. Hawthorne, a key advisor to the International Monetary Fund, had recently been accused of money laundering and election tampering after several high level officials of the... ♪ You can kiss me again If you want to ♪ ♪ I don't mind ♪ ♪ You can kiss me again If you want to ♪ ♪ That'd be fine ♪ ♪ Oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh ♪ ♪ And I guess We have to play ♪ ♪ The cards we've been dealt ♪ ♪ And I guess I got nothing ♪ ♪ Whatever happens happens ♪ ♪ 'Cause my life Is falling apart ♪ Yeah, should be an early flight. Hey, Jude. Can I walk you home? Well, the funeral was a joy. Yeah, sorry about that. Yeah. I know you had to do it all by yourself. I managed. I managed big time. - How's Mom? - Irritable. Oh. So she's fine, then. Here. Michael hates it. So that's still happening, huh? I'm sorry, okay? You're my fuckin' sister. Yeah, and you fuckin' left. It happened. I haven't seen you for eight years. I called you. Yeah, every six months, for you to deflect all our questions about where the fuck you are. You just quit drinking, disappeared, and left me holding all these bags of shit. I liked you better when you were a drunk. Nice. I'd invite you in... but Michael lives here with me now. I'll be at the hospital at nine if you want to meet me there. Hospital? Are you fucking kidding me? I emailed you last week. What? I figured that's why you're here. Ava, Mom had a heart attack. It wasn't a heart attack. You're such a drama queen. It was angina. It's nothing. Heart attack. Baby, will you get me that other blanket, please? The one on the chair? Thank you. You don't have to stand in the doorway. Now that you're finally here, you might as well join us... in the actual room. Here. Oh. No vase. Hey, which nurse is on tonight? Is it Gloria, the-the tall redhead? It's Sophie, Ma. Oh, she's nice too. Maybe she can get us a vase. Mm. They're very sweet to me. They give me extra desserts. Not that my waistline could use it. Well, I think you look great, Ma. Hm, I would have thought maybe you'd be shocked to see me this old, considering you haven't laid eyes on me in such a long time. You look exactly the same age. It's really great work. Come on, Ava. Thank you, Ava. But really, it's just my moisturizer. It's on the shelf in the bathroom if you want to grab some for yourself. It's funny, I never would have thought that the Netherlands would be that hot, but it seems like you're getting a little sun damage. Sun is a great idea. Let's get you in the chair, Ma. I'm not in the mood. Dad only thought about himself. Nonsense. Your dad was always pushing. Always indestructible, always thinking he was invincible. And charm? Pfft. To burn. He just charmed them all. He had that manipulative thing, like Ava. Your hair looks terrible. Thank you. Well it just... it just sits there, like, meh. You could wear it with some style. You're not in the army anymore. Well, I don't have anyone to impress. I could cut it for you while you're here, if you want. Well, I don't want to put you out. I cut Judy's hair all the time. It is how I earned my living before I gave up everything for you two. I do know what I'm doing. I'm sure you do, Ma. Forget that I mentioned it, I wish I never brought it up. Fuck, if you want to cut my hair, you can cut my hair, okay? Honey, how's Michael? - Uh... - Have you seen him yet, Ava? No, not yet. When you do, just remember, try not to make it all about you and your feelings, huh? So... Come on, let's hear it. Tell us all about the fancy job. Nothin' much to tell. So this one could be tricky. The approach should be flirty but classy. Anything aggressive is going to scare the General off. Is he married? Separated. What's the front door key? Larry Sullivan, a good friend of your father's and the General. Sunday lunches at your childhood home in London is a primary memory. Sullivan used to tell you and your little brother war stories after the meal. Got it, that's good stuff. Stick to the script this time? The General's a big weapons mover and shaker internationally, and management stressed that it has to appear like natural causes. The necessary materials along with your personal effects, will meet you in Riyadh. Go gentle on this one. all eyes are on us. Message received. You be great, kiddo. Head down. Powder dry. I know, I know. You think that is funny? I'm sorry. You really have a charming laugh. It's your third best quality. So what are my first and second best qualities, then? Of course, well, we could discuss this upstairs... I think at this time it's best if we both leave you alone. Miss Porter. I'm so glad Larry sent you. Mm. Mr. Sullivan's a good friend of my father's. Practically grew up with him at our house every weekend. Well, so leave us now, gentlemen. So, the ambassador is a very good friend of mine and lets me use his office to escape these horrible parties. May I see it? Yes. Please. So how are you enjoying this trip in Saudi Arabia? I must warn you... I'm a little slut. Oh, my God. I... I really like you. It's completely painless. It'll take about 15 minutes. Everyone will think you died of a stress-related heart attack. You did something bad. Right? They wouldn't have sent me if you hadn't. I wish I knew what it was. It was the name, right? Sullivan. Faulty fuckin' intel, right? I said the name wrong. Fuck you. Help! Help! Help! Get her downstairs, it looks like she's been hit. Help the General! Oh, my God! Let's get you down to safety. It'll be all right. Calm down. Almost there. Keep moving, please. I'm going to throw up if I don't sit down for a second. Don't move. Fuck. Sullivan, O'Sullivan. It's a typo. I disagree. Who was responsible? Well, let's say for the purposes of this conversation, it's my fault. I'm supposed to get you in and out safely. I failed. I'm sorry, darling. It was meant to look like natural causes. I can do natural causes. I know you can. I can do an accident. I can do gentle. I know. Duke, if you're gonna close me, just do it now. Management knows it's not your fault. Okay. They arranged for one of the more obscure Middle Eastern terror factions to claim responsibility. So some anti-Western group's gonna get 20 rocket launchers. It's an error. Let's move the fuck on. How did the General fall into our parameters? Ava, don't tell me you've been asking the subjects what they did wrong again. We're not going to survive another episode of that. Have you been using again? No. You're an addict. Do you remember what that behavior led to last time? Yeah. The hospitalization of three wait staff 'cause they... It's not like that this time. It's just, sometimes I just want to know why I'm closing somebody. Who gives a shit? You're client-facing. You're not a member of the parole board or a prison shrink. You're there to get the SignEasy on the toe tag. Yours is not to reason why, yours is to do or die. You know, I'm not going to be able to protect you a second time. Duke. I'm good. All right? I promise you. Well, management is going to be extra cautious. Okay. They want you off the grid for a beat or two. My father died. I know. You didn't kill him, did you? Okay. I need to go back to Boston anyway. Tie up some loose ends. Finish some stuff. That's a lot of pain points. I know that. You want me to tell management you'd like time off? Yeah. I already did. You asshole. You're such an asshole. And there you are. Michael? You look good. I don't. I don't. But thanks for saying it. You do, actually. Judy's inside with your mother. Oh. Some things never change, do they? Some things do. I'm happy for you guys. I really am. I probably should have told you my sister's in town. Yeah. You gonna start showing up without calling first? To visit my mother? I can hear you out there, you know. Come help me with this fucking TV! Can you believe Michael remembered? Thank you, Michael. Ava, can you believe Michael remembered I love irises? Uh, yeah, I can believe that he'd remember something like that. Want me to take a look at it? Nope. Leave it, you're going to break the whole damn thing. Uhh, it's fine, it's just the antenna. I've almost got it. The three of you should go out and have a nice dinner tomorrow night. - Uh. Ma, I... - No, no. Ava, take them somewhere nice. - Uh, I don't... - No, go on. Go on. Go on. I need to know the three of you get along. In case anything, you know, happens to me. Touch wood. Ma, stop it. Wow, you fixed it. Good work. Hm. I guess there was nothing wrong with it. About 10 years ago, at my most fucked up, I caught my dad having an affair. And I told him that if he didn't tell Mom, that I was going to do it myself. So... he cried. And he promised me that he would tell her about it. But what he did instead was... tell her that he caught me stealing money from his wallet. He said that I tried to blackmail him into giving me $1,000, and that if he wouldn't do it, that I would make up a story about him having an affair. I was a total alcoholic-addict piece of shit at the time who had been caught stealing money for drugs, so... naturally, she believed him. I don't blame her. But him... The look on his face when she was confronting me about it. It was like he was amused... for using me to save his ass. I couldn't get through that day without using. Made me want to kill him. Oh, I fuckin' fantasized about it. And I knew that if I didn't leave immediately, that I would. So... I left and I joined the army. When I heard he was dead, I knew it was safe to come back. That's all I got. Thank you for sharing. Hey, I'm Tony and I'm an alcoholic. Hi, Tony. - Hey. - Hey. So when are our Syrian friends going to claim responsibility, has that been arranged? Being arranged, as we speak. Okay. Goodness gracious me. That was a hiccup. That was more than a hiccup. The Saudi branch has completed refurbishment. They say they're ready to chase returns and get filled. They say there's no way it can lead back to us. There's one way. No, not her. I recruited her, I trained her. You recruited me, you trained me. I say she's a liability. Simon. She's best of breed. There's no way she can be ID'd. There's a risk factor. Have you forgotten? That was two years ago. And she had valid doubts about the ethical merits of a couple of closures. Valid doubts... the pursuit of which led her to have a fuckin' meltdown. And she got back on track. She's talking to the fuckin' targets! Again! You told me... when soldiers disobey the chain of command, people die. H-How do we know this? I heard her. I was in France. Saudi Arabia wasn't her fault, that's all I'm saying. So whose fault was it? My executive, my care and feeding, my responsibility. Well, thank you. Thank you for saying it. All right, then. She is the most gifted we have, you know that. Okay. She'll take a rest. Let the dust settle. I'll re-engage her when the time is right. That's the best decision. It's your decision, Duke. Just lettin' you make it. Yeah. Now get the fuck out of here and let me enjoy me son's christening. Yeah. Congrats. So? She's always been Duke's favorite, but she's a loose cannon and a danger to the organization. I wanted her killed in Riyadh so he wouldn't know it was us. But now... Call Alain. Tell him tooth or finger, I don't care which. I want to see a piece of her. Hm. What about Duke? Don't you worry about Duke. - But Dad... - Listen. Five days, that man was tortured, and he didn't give me up. Five days. But won't he know it was us? Doesn't matter, go outside to the party. Spend some time with your little brother, will you? Go on. Half-brother. I'm good. - I know you're angry... - Stop talking. I just... You know how I always say stop talking and you don't, and it's part of our hilarious banter? This time I'm actually telling you stop talking. You're showing me a gun? You know what happened to the last person who showed me a gun? And the person before that? And the person before that, and so on, if you follow my drift? Saudi Arabia was their fuckup. It was your fuckup, Duke. You're trying to close me? I know it may look like that, but honestly, and no offense, the company is not trying to close you. If they wanted you closed, you'd be closed. Uh-huh. And you're sure of that because...? Because it was discussed. Right. Of course it was fuckin' discussed. You keep breaking protocol. I warned you. Anyway, I told Simon you're not to be touched, and if he wanted to do something like that, he would have to involve me. And kill me. Say that again. The company had nothing to do with it. I got an ID on the guy from my sources at Boston PD. He's ex-French Special Forces, dishonorably discharged, and MIA for years. He had a drug problem. So it would seem that an exceptionally unlucky junkie tried to mug you... You don't believe that, Duke. Uh, because operatives with black arts combat training can't be addicts? I know you don't trust anybody. But I'm not anybody. So, I'm gonna take my hands out of my pockets, I'm gonna put them up like this, I'm going to step toward you... place them on your shoulders in a comforting, but firm, fatherly manner... and I'm going to ask you. Are you sure you don't want me to hang around for a few days, keep an eye on you? I came here to get a break from you, remember? Here's his gun. Can you run it for me? Will do. - He's a punk. - No. He's a punk. - Teddy's a great bass player. - He's a fine bass player. And 'fine' not as in, Oh, he's fine. 'Fine' as in average. You can do better. He hates Teddy coz he hit on me at the first gig we played. What? That's not true. I don't even remember that. Oh, you don't? - No? - No. Oh, she can't drink that. But first, bullshit you'd forgotten? Mm-hm. And second, he just didn't know that I had a boyfriend. Hm. Yeah, okay. Judy's in this incredible band, you gotta hear 'em. She heard actually. Thank you, by the way. She heard us play the other night. They're great. You should come hear them play at Wally's on Friday. You're playing Wally's Cafe? You're gonna blow up, Jude. Well, you're biased. Wow, you always wanted to play at Wally's. Come on, with all the fake modesty. You know you rant and rave every night about how underappreciated you guys are. Don't fucking say that. What? Could you not say that kind of fuckin' stuff in front of her? What kind of stuff? What did I say? You didn't say anything. Why are you fuckin' asking her? Don't laugh at me. Judy, he's not laughing at you. Okay, just don't do that. Listen, what I say at home, I say it at home. And I... I've just been complimenting you for the past 10 minutes, I was talkin' about how brilliant you are. Was that hard for you? No. Look, you know, what? I'm not gonna do this. - Was it a chore for you? - You're drunk. Okay? That's what it is, you're drunk. So. So, what's... what's your job like? How's it work? Oh, uh, it's not that interesting. Events and functions and endless cocktail parties where the food's terrible and I can't drink the free booze. What's the point? So... running around Beijing trying to find almond milk for the delegate from France who's lactose intolerant. Sounds like a glorified flight attendant. Oh, it's so weird being here. There's so many memories here. What memories? - Babe. - What? She said it. Let her explain it. I didn't mean what you're thinking, Jude. No? You did. You guys have fun. Je-sus. Well... she was happy for a while there. Mm-hm, and then? And then your father died. And she was the only one here to take care of everything. Then that, Ava. Okay. No, it's not, actually. What does that mean? Fine, I'll go talk to her. No. You don't get to come in here and try to fix everything. Okay? You don't get to be that person. Sorry. I'm the one who should apologize. I left without saying goodbye. You did. Yeah? Ava? Sorry it's so late, I don't know what to do. What do you mean you don't know what to do? Uh, Michael hasn't come home. He went out and he hasn't come home. Well, I'm sure he's just cooling off like he always does, right? You must be fucking loving this. Why would I love you waking me up at 5 am, yelling at me? Fine, you know what? I'm gonna go. Jude. I know you don't trust me. I know I let you down and disappeared. But I'm here now. Please... just talk to me. It's happened before. Sometimes he doesn't come home from... Come home from where? When did he start gambling again? He never stopped. Right. He's good at it. You know that. And we could really make a start with what he could pull down at the tracks. But I told him... no cards. I told him no fucking cards. Those people are... they're so crazy. You're sure he's playing cards? It's okay. I fucking... I hate it. 'Cause part of me is hoping you know where he is, and the other part is gonna be pissed if... So do you? No. Sorry. Haven't seen you in a while. Huh. Is she expecting you? Isn't she always? Fuck no. Hey, Toni. My little lost lamb... who threw up on my floor. That was eight years ago. I'm out. I found this pretty thing outside my door half-dead with a needle stuck between her toes. A lot has changed. I can see that. She's not a thankful person. I cleaned her up, let her live on my sofa. And then she took my rabbit's foot. Now she thinks she can take him again. Cash him out. He's got someplace he's gotta be. That someplace isn't with you anymore, is it? Looking good. How long you been clean? Long enough. Tick-tock. That's enough, Toni. Let's go. I always liked you... in my way. Don't push my patience. You need to go. I'm going to be here maybe a hour or so. How much are you into her for? He's not leaving this game. Listen... You heard her. Time to go. Get your fuckin' hands off me. Come on, Michael. Lead the way. Let's see how many holes I can put in her face before you shoot me. Put it away. Put it down. Who taught you those slick moves back there? You always were a quick study though, weren't you? You had everyone's number, right? I'm going to leave you here. You can get out now. It's tomorrow... and the next day and the day after that you need to worry about. How much? I don't care about the money. Let's pretend for a second that you do. How much does he owe you? Seventy five, give or take. Give me 36 hours. You don't fuck with him. That'd be mighty magnanimous of me. You got a lot of fucking nerve. I guess we both do. Yeah. What the fuck was that? Judy came to my hotel, she was worried about you. That's not what I'm talking about. All the stuff you was doing. Who the fuck is in front of me right now? Wonder Woman? I started studying martial arts when I was in rehab. Nah. No. Don't give me the story you give everybody else. You tell me the truth. Or get the fuck outta my face. Oh, it's like that now? You want to talk about my honesty? Look, I'm just trying to get out of debt. You do realize the number's meant to get smaller, right? No shit. Toni's no joke, Michael. Well, she's the only one who would stake me. That's helped you. Oh, yeah? Just what have you been up to, Cakes? Don't call me that, I'm not that person anymore. Oh, yes you are. You'll always be Cakes to me. I asked you to marry me, and you said yes. And then you just disappear for eight fuckin' years! I made a mistake with my family and I had to get away from it. You couldn't talk to me about it? So I got you a few days. How much can you rustle up? Not enough. Well, do you need cash? Not from you. What is your alternative, Michael? This is my alternative... right here. What the fuck are you going to do with that? You gonna kill her? I owe her 80 grand. Crush or no crush, lucky charm... she's gonna come for it. And I gotta think about Judy and... Hey. Don't do that. What are you doing? I'm not yours anymore. So you're happy. I asked her to marry me. And she said yes. Ava. Ava! What'll it be? Scotch, double. You got it. Shit. You want it on the rocks? Sure. Good. 'Cause you got it on the rocks. You a guest here at the hotel? Room number please? Ma'am? You want me to charge this to your room? Sure. Hey, man. Hey. I finally got me 73-year-old mother to agree to come over here. She's never been on a plane, she's never left Ireland. She's gonna be here within the hour, so at the expense of sounding like a pushy prick, what's on your mind? So, Saudi Arabia wasn't an error, was it? You set her up, you wanted her to get killed, right? I underestimated her. That was an error. I can see that now. And the executive you sent to Boston to close her? You haven't heard from him in 24 hours or so? That may count as an error as well. Go ahead and activate cleanup protocol on all of Alain's aliases. - But... - He's dead. Go on. I really didn't want to put you in the position of having to sanction the kill. Which you would have had to have done. The buck stops with me now. I gotta make the hard calls. You taught me this. You're not my superior officer anymore. Now, if that causes you any discomfort, Jesus, I'm sorry, but get the fuck over it. This isn't like the war. There are no sides. This is business, and it's brutal. And I know you like Ava. Wanted to spare your feelings. Rely on your understanding afterwards, you know? What does she think happened? Let's hope she thinks what I told her to think, that she was attacked by a junkie. I lied to her. Good. You need to rescind the kill order. You know I can't do that. Sure you can. Hey, what the fuck, man? Duke! Duke! I knew it was you! You did? Oh, boy. You knew it was me? Really? Hey, is it true that you are the prettiest in your family? Yes. Is it true that you're the smartest in your family? Yes. Your whole family? Come to Daddy, Monster. Come here. Oh my God, where's your mother? Shower. Yeah, did you sneak out on your own? Crafty. Well, Uncle Duke's gonna have a job for you with those skills. Oh, no, he won't. One daughter's enough? The field is no place for a lady. I think we've established that. Say goodbye to Uncle Duke, Monster. Bye, Uncle Duke. Bye, beautiful. All right you, get in there. Bring her out to her mother, and don't let her back out again. Yes, sir. No! Stop! It's not your fight, darlin'. Go on, get out of here, leave us alone. Leave us alone! Come in. You should have stayed at the hospital. You sure you don't want to give it a few more days? I certainly did not want to give it a few more days. I mean, just in case you're not completely... Ohhh! I hate that kind of talk. You can go to hell with your just in case garbage. Touch wood. Go on, touch wood. Both hands. Hearts. Anyone ever talk to you about going on some OCD medication? Ha. That's what you would like, isn't it? Drug me up and then throw me away in the loony bin. Here we go. Ma. I have to talk to you about something. You should choose carefully what you tell me, Ava. 'Cause you can't... un-say it, and I can't un-hear it. And I would love to believe that you work at the United Nations, honey, I really would. I'm sorry. I... I knew who your father was when I married him. I didn't want to look at that part of him, so... I focused on the half of him that made me happy and I, uh, ignored the half of him that broke my heart. If I'd have called him out then for screwing around, it'd be not only for his betrayal, it'd be because he lied about his daughter to save his own ass, and... well, any decent mother would have to leave the man then, right? I was scared to be alone. I chose him over you. That's why I didn't want to talk to you. I dreaded you calling every six months, because... you knew what I'd done. Whatever it is, whatever it is that you've been hiding... I don't care. Because I can see in your eyes that it's given you a strength... You would never do to your child... what I did to mine. I can see, you are not scared. And that... makes me very proud. Mom. Ava, it's your turn... and I have to win so I can get some rest. Okay? So... Day like this reminds me of home. Does it? Yeah. And I'm going to go to Boston. Take care of Ava meself. Mm. Good luck. Is there anything you'd like me to say to her before I put her in the earth? Well, tell her I'm sorry I couldn't be there to watch her cut your heart out. Will do. Yep? Management Code 980456. Executive Code, please? Executive Code 74598CG. Confirmed. Who's this? Hello Ava, I'm Simon. Did Duke ever tell you about me? No? Well, I'm not surprised. I was his first protégé. Broke him in for you, so to speak. I always said about Duke, if he didn't teach me everything I know, he certainly taught me all the useful shit. Well, I never fuckin' heard of you, man, so what do you want? I just killed him... because of you. If that's true, Simon... I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. I imagined you'd say that. Duke asked me to tell you he's sorry he won't be there to watch you cut out my heart. Is Judy here? No, Judy's at a gig right now. She, uh, she'll be back at around 1:00, 1:30. Come away with me. What? Come with me. Come with you where? Uh, I don't know. Just... go away together. Go someplace nobody can find us. Judy's pregnant. We weren't even tryin'. We just found out. She's here. Stay back. I asked Michael to run away with me. Do you believe that, Toni? My own sister's fiancé. I didn't even think about the consequences for Jude. I've never told anyone this... but I've been paid to kill 41 people. And even after all that... it wasn't until I did that to my sister... that I really knew what I was capable of. I know my secret's safe with you. Aaah! Now we're square. It's paid. Never, ever bother my family again. We're done now. Simon. It's a lovely morning for it, Ava. I see you took a trip to the minibar. What would Duke say? Tsk, tsk, tsk. Shocking. I'm a little bit rusty. Hey, come here! You know what, Simon? Shut up, babe. Oh, that's right. You don't like it when I talk to my subjects, do you? This time... I know what you did. Fuckin' hell. Count no man happy... Until the end is known. Yeah. Yeah, Duke made me read all that Greek shit too. I see why he liked you so much, Ava. You've got moxie. If I see you again, I will fucking kill you. Go that way. Attention, hotel guests, please evacuate the building. Do not attempt to use the elevators. Please use the stairwell. This is not a drill. Evacuate the hotel immediately. Management Code 98045FT. Put security around my family on high alert. Double the guard detail. The object is still open. Agh! My family. I have no interest in them. I do understand that if you... ...if you wanted to take your time with this. Count of five? Why not? One. I'm here for my sister. Holy... Oh my God, get in here, get inside. I need to talk to you alone. We're fine. We're fine. What happened? I need you to listen to me. Go get Mom and get out of the country tonight. Just for a month or two until I can contact you. What? Don't go to Europe or the UK. You sound crazy right now. Here's an account number and a code for an offshore account in my name. Memorize this and then burn it, Jude. There's $500,000 in there. Use whatever you need. Here's $20,000. This will be enough to get you all out of the country and safe. What the fuck? Jude, come on, listen. Are you fucking listening to me? I need to you to do exactly what I'm telling you to do. What? What is going on? Why would I do that? Because I need you to take care of the family the way I was never able to. All right? You're a momma now. Okay? You need to take care of your baby. I could never make him as happy as you obviously do. This came for you. Thank you. Ava. Who are you? Nobody that you want your child to know. Count no man as happy until his end is known. What Simon would call all that Greek shit. It's not until you know how someone dies that you know what really mattered to them. What they cared about, what they'd sacrifice for. What they would die for. Who they loved and who loved them in return. We don't have much control over our lives. But our end? Sometimes we write that story. If you're getting this, you know my end. I've never been happier.
